# Design Patterns in Go

This repository contains examples of common design patterns implemented in Go (Golang). The patterns covered in this repository include:

- Decorator
- Observer
- Singleton

## Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

### Example

```go
// Example code for Decorator Pattern
```

## Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

### Example

```go
// Example code for Observer Pattern
```

## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Example

```go
// Example code for Singleton Pattern
```

## Getting Started

To run the examples, clone the repository and run the Go files for each pattern:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/design-pattern.git
cd design-pattern
go run decorator/decorator.go
go run observer/observer.go
go run singleton/singleton.go
```
